* Prepend a space to flag that we do not want to align by this pattern but want to ignore beginning part of line, e.g. " \w   \w" will align by second word.

* Make it possible to enter 2 patterns which are separated by something (e.g. 3 spaces) and align on second pattern. This can be useful in aligning below code (extracted from a HAML file)

  %displayName   display_name
  %regionLabel   region_label
  %areaCodeLabel area_code_label
  %townLabel     town_label
  %isDefault     is_default
  
  Pattern: "%\w+   \w"     <=== align by second \w
